# Scrollytelling and Maps

## How To
I recommend installing Live Server from the VS-Code extensions, to view and edit the code.

## Maps

Let's start off with some basic web-map examples. There are different JavaScript Map-Libraries out there you can use. The most common ones I have added as an example to this repo. Each map includes a simple slippy map, with a base map, a marker and a popup for that marker.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)
- [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/)
- [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/)
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/)

You can get other basemaps from:

- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers)
- [Maptiler](https://openmaptiles.org/styles/)

Vector tile layer styles can also be created using the [Maputnik editor](https://github.com/maputnik/editor).

## Scrollytelling

This is an introduction for storytelling that requires only "little" knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and specifically focuses on maps. If you want to build more complex scrollytelling pages, i strongly recommend that you head over to the [Scrollytelling for Beginners tutorial](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/scrollytelling-beginners).

In the two examples in this repository you will actually not write much JavaScript yourself, it works mostly by modifying config files and editing HTML (adding text and images).

### Scrollytelling Maps

A [blog post](https://blog.mapbox.com/how-to-build-a-scrollytelling-map-ead6baf2cd1b) by mapbox on the technology, explains how to use it. More documentation in the [repo](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling). A quick demo can be found [here](https://demos.mapbox.com/scrollytelling/). Someone has extended the code, to allow for [animated lines](https://github.com/willymaps/scrollydrive) while scrolling, further explanation on this [here](http://www.formerspatial.com/scrolly-drive).

### Scrollytelling Content

Uses [Scrollma](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama/). A couple of examples are included.

### Other Scrollytelling Libraries:

- [Scroll Trigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/)
- [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/)
- [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/)
- [graph-scroll.js](https://1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/)
- [ScrollStory](https://sjwilliams.github.io/scrollstory/)
- [enter-view](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/enter-view)
