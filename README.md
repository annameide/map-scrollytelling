## Concept
“The Seed Tracker” project was developed as part of the “Karten der Macht. Macht der Karten” course by Prof. Sebastian Meier. The solo work consists of a scrollytelling website which presents the reader with a dystopian science-fiction short story accompanied by a dynamic map, illustrated with photocollages.

The concept of The Seed Tracker aims to convey a serious topic - the climate disaster and the accompanying change in local food production - in a way that is cognitively as easy to absorb as possible.

The means used to achieve this goal are a fictional text style, a dynamic map, and illustrations. The form of a sci-fi short story is intended to convey the content on a textual level more lightly than a scientific text, such as the IPCC report for example. The dynamic map, which changes in relation to the text sections, is intended to create a sense of local connection to the site. The illustrations are intended to support impressions of change on an emotional „at-a-glance“ level that work differently than rational, linear texts.

Ideally, this dystopian exaggeration leads to the conclusion that such a future is not desirable for anyone and motivates the reader to engage in protection of the environment in the here and now.
